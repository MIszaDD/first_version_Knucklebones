## Overview

This project is a simple text-based dice game where two players, "Player 1" and "Player 2", take turns rolling a virtual dice and placing the result in one of the columns of their respective game tables. The objective is to score the most points by strategically placing the dice rolls in the appropriate columns and attempting to block or reduce the opponent's score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### How to Play
```
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The game will start automatically with Player 1 taking their turn.
3. Players take turns rolling the dice (simulated by the program) and choosing a column to place the result.
4. The game checks if the selected column is full or if any opponent's dice result can be removed from that column.
5. The game continues until all columns are filled.
6. The program calculates and displays the final scores of both players.
