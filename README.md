# first_version_Knucklebones
This is a simple implementation of the game Knucklebones, created in Python. Please note that this was my first coding project, so the game isn't written particularly well. The scoring system works, but the points multiplier is not implemented in the best way, and there are likely some inefficiencies in the code.
